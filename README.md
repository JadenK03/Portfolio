# Portfolio
This portfolio features a few of the coding projects I have worked on over the years. I've lost a few of them due to storage issues and corruption.
The "WebsiteProject" files feature a project I worked on with two others. We were tasked with creating a website for a fake restaurant with multiple functions, such as a way to create an account, a shopping cart for orders, a map with the restaurant's location, and other features. This project was moved to GitHub at one point, so the progression was fairly well documented.
