# Portfolio
This portfolio features a few of the coding projects I have worked on over the years. I've lost a few of them due to storage issues and corruption.

The "WebsiteProject" files feature a project I worked on with two others. We were tasked with creating a website for a fake restaurant with multiple functions, such as a way to create an account, a shopping cart for orders, a map with the restaurant's location, and other features. This project was moved to GitHub at one point, so the progression was fairly well documented.

The R Data Analysis folder contains a project I completed that demonstrates how various data visualization concepts can identify relationships between skills and highlight potential areas for improvement in specific skills. In this project, I used MLB statistics, but this approach can be applied elsewhere as well.
